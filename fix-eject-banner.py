"""
Fixes an annoyance with macOS Big Sur and 'DISK NOT EJECTED PROPERLY'
notifications (which occur with every CircuitPython board disconnect or
reset). Changes notification from an alert (which pile up until each is
manually dismissed) to a banner (auto dismissed after a few seconds),
as it behaved in prior macOS releases.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. MODIFIES USER'S ncprefs.plist FILE.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU SAVE A BACKUP FIRST, e.g.:
  cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ncprefs.plist ~/Desktop
REQUIRES python3.
